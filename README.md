## Welcome
Magento Cloud Docker is a package—part of the [Magento Cloud Suite](#magento-cloud-suite)—designed to develop, test, and deploy your Magento Commerce store. The Magento Cloud Docker implementation deploys Cloud projects to a local workstation so that you can develop and test your code in a simulated Cloud environment.
